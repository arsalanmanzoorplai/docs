### Catalog Management:

A product catalog is a collection of items you can manage programmatically and use in Meta shops, ads, and feeds.

### 🛠 Typical Workflow:

1. **Get or create** a catalog via `get_catalogs_list` or `create_catalog`.  
2. **Set up a product feed** using `create_catalog_products_feed`, then upload your product file.  
3. **Monitor feed imports** via `get_catalog_products_feed`.  
4. **List catalog items** using `get_catalog_products_list`.  
5. **Group items** using `create_catalog_product_set` and adjust with `edit_catalog_product_set`.

These endpoints support Meta Shops, dynamic ads, WhatsApp product integrations, and synchronized inventory management.

### ✅ Key Requirements & Best Practices:

- Access token must include **catalog_management** and **business_management** scopes, and initial ToS must be accepted in Commerce Manager.  
- **Bulk feeds** ensure scalable catalog syncing—use supported formats (CSV, TSV, RSS/XML, Google Sheets).  
- Include essential item attributes such as `id`, `title`, `price`, `availability`, `image_url`, `retailer_id` in feeds.  
- Monitor feed statuses and logs to catch upload issues early.  
- Use product sets to group items for promotions, categories, or ads targeting.
