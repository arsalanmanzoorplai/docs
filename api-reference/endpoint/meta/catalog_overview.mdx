description: "A catalog in Meta Commerce Manager is a digital inventory that stores all your products and product sets, making it easy to organize, update, and showcase your items on Facebook and Instagram. With our API, you can list your catalogs, view and manage products, create new catalogs, upload product feeds for bulk updates, and organize products into sets—all to keep your Meta shop up-to-date and well-structured."

## What Can You Do With Our Catalog APIs?

Our API provides endpoints to help you programmatically manage your catalogs and their contents. With these APIs, you can:

- **List all catalogs** associated with your account
- **View all products** within a specific catalog
- **Create new catalogs** for your business
- **Upload product feeds** to add or update multiple products in bulk
- **Check the status** of product feed uploads
- **Create product sets** to group products within a catalog
- **Edit product sets** to update or modify existing groups

> 📘 These features help you keep your product data organized and up-to-date across Meta platforms.

### 🛠 Typical Workflow:

1. **Get or create** a catalog via `get_catalogs_list` or `create_catalog`.  
2. **Set up a product feed** using `create_catalog_products_feed`, then upload your product file.  
3. **Monitor feed imports** via `get_catalog_products_feed`.  
4. **List catalog items** using `get_catalog_products_list`.  
5. **Group items** using `create_catalog_product_set` and adjust with `edit_catalog_product_set`.

These endpoints support Meta Shops, dynamic ads, WhatsApp product integrations, and synchronized inventory management.

### ✅ Key Requirements & Best Practices:

- Access token must include **catalog_management** and **business_management** scopes, and initial ToS must be accepted in Commerce Manager.  
- **Bulk feeds** ensure scalable catalog syncing—use supported formats (CSV, TSV, RSS/XML, Google Sheets).  
- Include essential item attributes such as `id`, `title`, `price`, `availability`, `image_url`, `retailer_id` in feeds.  
- Monitor feed statuses and logs to catch upload issues early.  
- Use product sets to group items for promotions, categories, or ads targeting.
